ideas and goals of the project

#### Inspirations and Personal Goals
- The goal of this project is to get some practice writing and also to see how these kinds of systems work. 
- I'm drawing inspiration from other turn based games like various games made from RPG maker. Another big part is that I want to include the possibility to create unique builds for the various classes I plan on including. This idea stems from playing league of legends, specifically the arena game mode. I was interested in the way Riot does the scaling for the abilities of the champions and how you could create new ways to play different champions or how you could do certain builds to maximize the scaling potential for some abilities, mathematically correct sett is what comes to mind.

#### System Goals 
- I think the type of system I described above may be out of scope for my own abilities with respect to completing something within a reasonable time.
- With that said the bare minimums for the project I want to do are as follows.
	1. create a simple and effective UI from scratch.
	2. implement a turn system.
	3. multiple abilities or effects for each class.
	4. allow the computer controlled entities their own turns using some game theory to decide which action to take.
